### What To & How To
- Here as we are testing the application we will be running both server and client on same device.
- We only need to debug the code of both client and server and be able to successfully run in on your system and make them communicate(in your system itself)
- Downolad the provieded files and open it in an ide of your choice and debug the errors in the code file(s) as they were already commented out to make your work easier.(You need check both the codes for client and server)
- For running it, open both client and server directories in seperate and using the 'dotnet run' command you can run those.
- Note: you should run the server first and then client, otherwise they won't be able to run.

### Bonus
- You can add any extra features to the application like asking about any other extra date, etc. It can be anything else.

### Working Sample
- The below video shows how the final application should run like
